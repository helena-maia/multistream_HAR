# Multi-Stream Convolutional Neural Network for Action Recognition Based on Adaptive Visual Rhythm

This repository contains some files that were taken originally from [Two Stream Pytorch](https://github.com/bryanyzhu/two-stream-pytorch).

The main contribution focuses on the creation of a new stream (convolutional neural network) that is trained with different type of visual rhythm images generated from videos of UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. 

## Installation

Tesded on PyTorch
```
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
